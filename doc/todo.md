# Problems to investigate
- ~captains_module_c2_ssd_book_012 is half a starbase.~
- Some of the SSDs in Module C2 don't have the exact `Book: Captain's Module C2 SSD Book` value.
- Same as above for R2 Module.
- ~Pages missing/duplicated in R2 Module!  For example, captains_module_r2_ssd_book_077 is the same as captains_module_r2_ssd_book_057a.~
- Move the SSD Commander's Volume I files into another directory, because they don't have Type or BPV or Ref in them.
